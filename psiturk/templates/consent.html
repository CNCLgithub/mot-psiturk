                    <b>Purpose:</b> We are conducting research on reasoning.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <b>Brief description:</b> In this experiment, you will make
                    judgments about various properties of objects and/or agents.
                    In total, we think making these judgments will take less than 30 minutes to complete.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <b>Procedures:</b> In each trial, you will view images and answer
                    some range slider questions.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <b>Risks and Benefits:</b> Completing this task poses no
                    more risk of harm to you than do the experiences of everyday
                    life (e.g., from working on a computer). Although this study
                    will not benefit you personally, it will contribute to the
                    advancement of our understanding of human reasoning .
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <b>Confidentiality:</b> All of the responses you provide
                    during this study will be anonymous. You will not be asked
                    to provide any identifying information, such as your name,
                    in any of the questionnaires. Typically, only the
                    researchers involved in this study and those responsible for
                    research oversight will have access to the information you
                    provide. However, we may also share the data with other
                    researchers so that they can check the accuracy of our
                    conclusions; this will not impact you because the data are
                    anonymous. The researcher will not know your name, and no
                    identifying information will be connected to your survey
                    answers in any way. The survey is therefore anonymous.
                    However, your account is associated with an mTurk number
                    that the researcher has to be able to see in order to pay
                    you, and in some cases these numbers are associated with
                    public profiles which could, in theory, be searched. For
                    this reason, though the researcher will not be looking at
                    anyone's public profiles, the fact of your participation in
                    the research (as opposed to your actual survey responses) is
                    technically considered "confidential" rather than truly
                    anonymous.

                    to end your participation at any time for any reason, or to

                    like to talk with someone other than the researchers to
                    discuss problems or concerns, to discuss situations in the
                    event that a member of the research team is not available,
